DEVELOPING Motomapia
====================


Watchdogs
---------
You will want to run the watchdog processes that look for changes in the raw .sass or .coffee
files and compile them into the output automatically:

Install Node.js
Install CoffeeScript
Install Sass

run watch-coffee.sh
run watch-sass.sh
